Recall that most well-behaved functions (to be precise, the analytic functions) can be written as a power series. That is, most functions can be written as
${f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n}$
for some ${\{c_n\}}$. This looks almost exactly like the decomposition of a vector ${\vec v}$ into a given basis ${\{\vec e_i\}}$,
${\vec{v}=\sum_{i} c_i\vec e_i}$. Thus, let us conjecture that the analytic functions form a vector space, with basis vectors ${\{x^n\}}$. Note that this differs from most vector spaces that we have seen already in that it is (countably) infinite-dimensional: as opposed to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional vector spaces we have seen with basis vectors ${\hat\imath,\hat\jmath,\text{and }\hat k}$, the space of analytic functions has countably infinitely many basis vectors, one for each non-negative integer ${n}$.


Usually, we prefer that basis vectors are orthonormal: different basis vectors should have a dot product of zero, and the norm of each basis vector should be ${1}$. In three dimensional space, we express this by writing
${
    ||\hat\imath||
  = ||\hat\jmath||
  = ||\hat k||
  = 1
}$
and
${
   \hat\imath\cdot\hat\jmath =
   \hat\jmath\cdot\hat k =
   \hat k\cdot\hat\imath =0
}$.


Problem 1: Check that the basis proposed, ${\{x^n\}}$, is not orthonormal


Luckily, we can use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthonormalize these vectors. Recall that if we have some basis
${\{e_i\}}$
that we wish to orthonormalize, we can find an orthonormal basis ${\{\epsilon_i\}}$ using the following formula:
